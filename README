	Musical Organiser or in short Murga is a php script which sorts out the mp3 files
as originals and copies depending upon their Id3v1 tags.
	Mp3 files nowadays are freely available for listening to and downloading from several
different sources. The major problem that arises when a group (friends/family) share such
media is that a person may end up with multiple copies of the same mp3 file, but nested 
inside in a different folder hierarchy. This just increases the used space on the disk and 
requires a lot of effort if one decides to visit each folder and sort it out himself/herself
manually.
	Murga is a script which relieves us from this trouble of manual labour and provides us 
with the originals and copies of the mp3 files sorted out in two different folders maintaining
their directory structure.

How to use ?

1) Download Id3.php and fileOrg.php files.
2) Open the fileOrg.php using a text editor of your choice.
3) Go to line $source = "";
4) Fill the path to your root directory in these quotes.
	* Root directory is a folder from which the script should start searching for mp3 files
	recursively in its subfolders.
	* If you store your songs in "D:/Entertainment/Music" folder give the source path as
	  "D://Entertainment//Music"
	*Follow these rules :
		->Replace \ in the path with \\.
		->Path should end with a folder name and not \\.
5) Go to line $dest = "";
6) Fill the path where you want to sort it and back it up to within these quotes.
	* If you want to store the sorted backup in "E:/Sorted" folder give the dest path as
	  "E://Sorted"
	*Follow these rules :
		->Replace \ in the path with \\.
		->Path should end with a folder name and not \\.
7) Save and run this php script in your localhost.

Outcome :

You will have a sorted copy of the entire contents of the source folder that you gave in 
the destination path with the directory structure maintained ecaxtly the same.
Sorted contents will be in folder : MusicOrganiser
Originals will be in : MusicOrganiser/Originals
Copies will be in : MusicOrganiser/Copies
